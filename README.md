## Requirements

This browser based app requires CORS support from the OpenID Connect provider for the Token Endpoint. Most providers will support CORS but there are some exceptions.

There is no backend. Browser's [local storage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#webstorage) is used to store any configuration information.
